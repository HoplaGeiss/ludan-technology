Managed 24/7 is an IT managed support services focused on predictive management, monitoring, and analytics. They hired me to work on their new cloud-based real-time analytics system.

During my almost 2 years at Managed 24/7, I lead the UI developement of a world-class application from scratch. The technology stack was Mongo, Express, Angular (6), and Node.js. The application relies heavily on real-time data and dashboards. Therefore I also got plenty of exposure to socket.io, gridster, and d3.js.
